          <h2>Charming Even in Success</h2>
          <p>
            Portland was actually the first capital of Maine when it was
            established in 1832 <cite>[2]</cite>. Despite no longer being the
            capital of the state, the city is still a wonderful city. Downtown
            is bustling with life and culture, and despite the size of the city
            it still has a distinct charm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Portland provides plenty of economic opportunity for the businesses
            that line its streets. The city has a strong tourism economy, with
            tourists spending over $8.6 billion in 2022 <cite>[4]</cite>. The
            influx of visitors and money from outside the city allows businesses
            to make far more than they would if they were only meeting the needs
            of the locals.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a lot to see in Portland. The bustling waterfront provides
            sight-seeing and exploration on its many docks. Events such as the
            Maine Lobster Festival and Yarmouth Clam Festival are held yearly in
            the city, giving locals and visitors alike even more to do
            <cite>[5]</cite>.
