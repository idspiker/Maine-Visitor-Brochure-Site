          <h2>What About Bar Harbor?</h2>
          <p>
            Bar Harbor’s notoriety as a summer retreat began early in its
            history. In the 1800s, people were already building summer cottages
            and hotels to host guests seeking out the beauty of the mountains
            and coasts <cite>[2]</cite>. Even now, almost two centuries later,
            the allure of the mountains brings many visitors to this resort
            town. In the summer and fall the tourist scene booms. Local
            businesses and restaurants make the bulk of their profit in the
            summer while cruise ships pour hundreds of visitors into Bar Harbor
            each day. You can buy anything from bar harbor souvenirs to fresh
            caught lobster at the height of the season.
          </p>
          <p>
            The town empties out in the winter. Without the tourists to do
            business with, many shops close for the off season. As many people
            only live and work in Bar Harbor in the summer, the population also
            drops significantly in the winter. In the tourist season, the town’s
            population is over 18,000, but during the winter it is only around
            5,000 <cite>[4]</cite>.
